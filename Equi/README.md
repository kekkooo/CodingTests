# Equi
This is the solution I came up for a coding test taken from [Codility](http://codility.com).
Scala implementation fails with big numbers since they cause overflow in sums (TODO).

You're provided with an array A of integers and you sould find the index i for which the sum of the elements with index < i is equal to the sum of the elements with index > i.
